# Greenplum-specific tests
#
# The order of the tests is fairly random, but there are a couple of things
# to consider when placing a new test:
#
# * Keep long-running tests in the same group with other tests with a similar
#   runtime. That way, on a multi-processor system, the tests will finish
#   roughly at the same time, which maximizes parallelism.
# * Keep tests together with other tests for similar functionality.
# * There are some dependencies between tests, and some tests cannot run
#   in parallel with other tests.
# * The maximum size of a group is about 20, like in the Postgres
#   parallel_schedule. However, some queries can dispatch a lot of workers
#   to the segments, and therefore has to run in smaller groups to avoid
#   hitting max_connections limit on segments.

# catalog test uses pg_get_constraintdef which may report ERROR when executed
# concurrently with other tests. Cause pg_get_constraintdef() looks up
# information on the constraint from the syscache, which uses SnapshotNow to
# fetch the information. But the query itself uses an MVCC snapshot. If the
# query's MVCC snapshot sees a constraint that is concurrently dropped so that
# it's not visible to SnapshotNow, you get error.
#
# This has been fixed in PostgreSQL 9.4, as part of a larger patch that relaxed
# locking requirements of ALTER TABLE
